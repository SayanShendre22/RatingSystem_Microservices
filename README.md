🚀 Hotel Rating Microservices Project 🏨

I’m excited to share a recent project I’ve been working on that showcases the power of microservices architecture. This project consists of fully independent services that together create a seamless Hotel Rating platform. 

Here's a brief overview of the microservices involved:

- User Service: Manages user information and authentication, ensuring secure access and a personalized experience.
- Hotel Service: Handles all hotel-related data, including details, availability, and amenities.
- Rating Service: Manages user ratings and reviews, providing valuable feedback for hotels.
- Config Server: Centralized configuration management using an external config file hosted on GitHub, enabling dynamic updates across all services.
- API Gateway: Acts as the single entry point, handling request routing, composition, and security, ensuring smooth and secure communication between clients and microservices.
- Service Registry (Eureka Server): Facilitates service discovery, enabling dynamic scaling and ensuring high availability.

This project demonstrates:

- Scalability: Each service is independently deployable and scalable.
- Resilience: Built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms ensure that the platform remains robust even under high load.
- Flexibility: Easily adaptable to new features and services, allowing for continuous improvement.
🔗 The project’s configuration management is powered by a centralized config server with external configuration files hosted on GitHub, streamlining updates and reducing deployment overhead.

💡 This architecture not only simplifies development and deployment but also provides a strong foundation for building complex, enterprise-grade applications.

I’m proud of the work put into this and excited about the possibilities it opens up. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more or collaborate on similar projects!
